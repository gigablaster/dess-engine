My own vulkan-based game engine. I'm trying to implement everything in way I want it to work based on my more than 10 years
of experience in game development. Most of the features are kind of baseline.

# Features
- Written on Rust from start to finish.
- Data-orientired design.
- Some degreee of multithreading, as much as I need.
- Handle-based API, HypeHype-style (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3bW8d4Brec)
- Async asset loading
